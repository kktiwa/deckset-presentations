## Data Governance: What is it?

> Data governance is about understanding the data your organization has and having a *structured framework* of roles and responsibilities to manage it. 
This ensures that the *right people* can make *consistent decisions* about the quality and use of your data.

> Both data quality management and data governance are critical data management activities.After all, there’s not much point managing your data if you aren’t sure if it is the right data, or if it is of good enough quality to use.

## What should we govern?

+ What should we govern?
	- Data at rest
	- Data in flight
	- Data access
	- Policies
	- Dark Data

## What good governance could look like?

+ Team Shape: Data Stewards, Data Engineers and Data Owners
+ Decentralized ownership: Codifying principles makes it easy
+ Metadata: Build with metadata being a first-class citizen which informs policy decisions
+ Cloud-native policies: Leverage cloud
+ Center for Internet Security (CIS Benchmarks): The CIS Benchmarks are prescriptive configuration recommendations for more than 25+ vendor product families. They represent the consensus-based effort of cybersecurity experts globally to help you protect your systems against threats more confidently.

## Common Pitfalls

- Leaving it too late

^ Too often, data governance only makes it onto the
agenda when data quality issues have caused significant harm, or
when new systems have failed due to poor data quality?

- Siloing responsibility

^ Many business users believe (mistakenly) that
IT owns all data. Use your data governance roles to make it clear who
is responsible for what. Done well, data governance breaks down silos
and improves collaboration within the organization?

- Applying short-term fixes over long-term strategy

^ Data governance can take a long time to implement and deliver value, so
the tendency to opt for quick fixes is understandable. However, shortterm
tactical fixes often have to be repeated regularly, leading to a
culture where “data wrangling” becomes the norm. We need to find
ways of delivering value while developing and implementing a
comprehensive Data Governance Framework to ensure proactive and
ongoing data quality.

- Communicating poorly

## What ROI should you measure?


+ Usage
+ Data Quality Levels
+ Violations internal and external
+ Time to detect a violation
+ Time to implement a policy change
